# JustOne

A minimalist journaling or accountability app where you can add exactly one thing per day. It could be one photo, one sentence, or one checklist item you completed. The severe constraint is the entire feature. It fights the pressure of elaborate journaling by making the goal absurdly achievable.


## Features

- **One Entry Per Day**: Strictly enforces a single entry per day (text, image, or both).
- **Local Storage**: All data is saved directly on the device; no accounts or backend needed.
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean and intuitive interface with a focus on simplicity.
- **Developer Mode**: Option to bypass the one-entry-per-day limit for testing or specific use cases.
- **Delete Entries**: Ability to remove individual entries.
- **Customizable Settings**: Toggle delete button visibility and image cropping.
